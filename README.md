## 📖 Project Overview  
Hospitals handle thousands of patients daily, each bringing unique needs, wait times, and satisfaction levels.  
This project transforms **raw hospital patient data** into a **clear and interactive Power BI dashboard** — allowing hospital administrators, doctors, and analysts to make informed decisions that enhance patient care and operational efficiency.  

From tracking **admissions** to identifying **peak hours** and analyzing **patient demographics**, this dashboard helps answer the question: *How can we serve patients better and faster?*

## 🔍 Key Visualizations  
- **Total Patients** — Quickly view the total number of patients served.  
- **Average Waiting Time** — Identify areas to reduce delays.  
- **Average Patient Satisfaction Score** — Gauge overall care quality.  
- **Admitted vs Not Admitted** — Understand patient flow.  
- **Patients by Age Group** — Spot demographic patterns.  
- **Patients by Department** — Allocate resources where needed.  
- **Satisfaction by Seen Time** — Measure service efficiency.  
- **Patients by Gender** — Gender-based distribution.  
- **Hourly & Daily Trends** — Optimize staffing for peak times.

## 💡 Insights & Analysis  
- Out of **9,216 patients**, almost **half (4,612)** were admitted.  
- The **average waiting time is 35 minutes**, suggesting opportunities for process improvement.  
- **Patient satisfaction is high** (avg. score of 4.99), but 29.84% of patients remain unsatisfied — a key area to address.  
- **Age group 30–39** has the highest patient count, indicating a strong mid-age demand.  
- **General Practice** is the busiest department, while specialties like Cardiology and Neurology have fewer cases.  
- **Saturday sees the highest patient visits**, and **15:00–20:00** is peak visiting time — critical for staff scheduling.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Power BI** — Interactive dashboard creation.  
- **Excel/CSV Data** — Patient records and hospital operational data.  
- **SQL/MySQL** — (Optional) Data storage and querying before visualization.
